# Beta diagnostics

Synara Beta ships always-on diagnostics so the team can see crashes and release
health on real machines instead of waiting for bug reports. This document is the
authoritative description of what leaves your computer.

**Stable builds collect nothing.** The diagnostics module is only constructed
when the packaged build's `synaraDesktopFlavor` field equals `"beta"` — a field baked
in at build time that cannot be flipped by an environment variable. (The module
source is bundled into the shared desktop code, but in a stable build it is
never instantiated: no UI, environment variable, or IPC can enable it.)

## What is collected

Thirteen event names, each with a small fixed field set. The full allowlist
lives in `apps/desktop/src/betaDiagnostics.ts` (`BetaDiagnosticsEventName` and
the `sanitizeBetaDiagnosticsPayload` schemas); the ingest worker re-validates
the same allowlist server-side.

`app.error` fires when the main process throws an uncaught exception, the
renderer throws an uncaught exception or rejects a promise, or the renderer
logs a console error. Renderer exceptions retain their original stacks through
a fixed, bounded IPC payload. The bridge is exposed only when the Beta main
process enables it, and reports from other windows or subframes are rejected.
Malformed exception fields produce a generic report without serializing objects.
Console errors remain a fallback during startup and for browser errors such as
CORS failures. Once the renderer listeners are ready, their uncaught exceptions
are not also counted through that fallback. The same fingerprint is sent at
most once per 10 minutes and at most 30 errors per hour per session. Loopback
HTTP and WebSocket URL ports are normalized only for fingerprinting; the redacted
message keeps the original port so it can still help diagnosis.

Crash events exclude clean process exits and known app shutdowns, including
backend processes deliberately stopped for an updater handoff. An unexpected
`killed` process remains reportable; a signal alone does not prove shutdown.

`update.check` records the start of a check, not a successful result. Its
`outcome: "ok"` means the attempt started. Failures emit `update.error` with the
check/download/install context and a redacted updater message.
Download and install failures emit this event even when the UI keeps the
`available` or `downloaded` status so the user can retry. Repeated broadcasts of
the same failure do not emit another event; a new failed attempt does.

`usage.daily` works differently from the other events: the main process cannot
read the projection database, so the server writes
`~/.synara-beta/diagnostics/usage-snapshot.json` every 6 hours (counts only —
provider names, thread and turn counts, project count) and the main process
relays it once per UTC day. `beta.installed` is emitted once, on the first
backend start after a fresh install, and says whether stable data was imported.
`beta.left` fires when you switch back to stable and says only whether the beta
app was moved to the Trash.

Every event also carries: a random per-install UUID, `flavor: "beta"`,
`platform`, `arch`, the app version, and a timestamp; `app.start` additionally
carries the OS version (major.minor) and UI language. The install UUID is
generated locally on first launch (`crypto.randomUUID`) — it is not derived
from your hardware, account, or IP.

Crash dumps: Electron's `crashReporter` uploads minidumps to the diagnostics
endpoint. Minidumps are memory snapshots of the crashed process and can in
principle contain fragments of that process's memory; they are stored in R2 and
can't be redacted. They are kept with no expiry date.

## What usage counters do not collect

- Chat messages, prompts, agent output, or transcripts (usage events carry counts only)
- File contents, workspace contents, project names, or git metadata
- Provider keys, tokens, or anything under `secrets/`
- IP-derived identifiers, device IDs, or account identity
- Screenshots, window contents, or keystrokes

These are not intentionally sampled for the usage counters. Free-text error
fields may still contain fragments of work despite redaction, and raw crash
minidumps can contain fragments of process memory, including sensitive data.

The only free-text fields are `message`, `stack`, and `logTail`. Before they
are written to the queue, each is passed through `redactDiagnosticText`
(`packages/shared/src/diagnosticsRedaction.ts`), which strips PEM blocks, git
remote URLs, emails, URL credentials, query strings, and the path of every
network URL (`https://github.com/org/repo` becomes `https://github.com/…`),
`Authorization`/`Bearer`/`Cookie` values, known token shapes (API keys,
GitHub/Slack/AWS/Google tokens, JWTs), sensitive `key=value`/`key: value`
fields, IP addresses, and any remaining long opaque token (hex, base64url, or
standard base64). Paths are reduced to the last segment: `/Users/you/code/my-repo/app.ts` becomes `~/…/app.ts`, so
folder and repository names are not sent. Redaction is best-effort — error
text can still include fragments of whatever was on screen. The worker runs
the same redaction again before storing.

Renderer error fields use the same shared redactor before crossing the bounded
IPC bridge. PEM blocks are removed whole before the field length limit is
applied, so truncation cannot leave a key fragment for the main process to
misclassify. The main process redacts these fields again before queueing them.
Loopback HTTP/WebSocket URL hosts become `localhost`, keeping their ports
readable and recognizable for fingerprint grouping across both redaction passes.
External IP addresses remain redacted and external ports remain distinct.

## Transport and storage

Events are buffered to `~/.synara-beta/diagnostics/events.jsonl` and flushed in
batches as NDJSON over HTTPS to `https://synara-beta-diagnostics.kartik-9f9.workers.dev`
(override with `SYNARA_BETA_DIAGNOSTICS_URL` for local development; only `https://`
or loopback targets are accepted). Events land in a Cloudflare D1 database and
are kept with no expiry date, so crash and error trends can be compared across
all beta releases. Crash dumps land in the `synara-beta-crash-dumps` R2 bucket
and are also kept with no expiry date. The ingest worker
and its private dashboard live outside this repository (they run on the
maintainers' Cloudflare account). The worker re-runs the same allowlist and
`redactDiagnosticText` and drops unknown events/fields, so the documented
schema is enforced at the endpoint, not just the client.

Ingest is intentionally open. Beta builds are public binaries, so any token
baked into them would be public too, and Electron's crash uploader cannot send
custom headers anyway. Abuse is bounded instead: per-IP rate limits (120
requests a minute for ingest, 10 for login), request and dump size caps, and
the server-side allowlist and redaction.

If the endpoint is unreachable the queue stays on disk and retries on the next
flush; if it grows past 1 MiB the client trims it to the newest 512 KiB of
events rather than letting it grow. Diagnostics never blocks the app: every
failure is swallowed.
