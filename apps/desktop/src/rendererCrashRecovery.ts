//          be reloaded automatically, the reload backoff, and the cap that stops a loop.
// Layer: Desktop window supervision
// Exports: RendererCrashPolicy

 * Automatic reloads allowed inside one crash streak before the user is asked instead.
 *
 * A renderer that dies deterministically (a crash on first paint, a leak that OOMs the
 * moment state is restored) would otherwise reload forever, burning CPU and rewriting
 * the same crash to disk. Three attempts across ~3.5s of backoff rides out a transient
 * GPU or OOM kill, and stops well short of a spin loop.
