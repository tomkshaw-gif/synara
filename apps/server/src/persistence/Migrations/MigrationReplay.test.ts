/**
 * A released migration id was renumbered once (54 shipped as
 * `ProjectPullRequestPins`, then became `DurableProviderCommandDelivery`).
 * Lineage reconciliation answers a divergence by forgetting every tracker row
 * from that point onward, which makes the migrator replay the range over a
 * schema that already contains it — migration 56 died on
 * `duplicate column name: fingerprint_version` and the backend never booted.
 *
 * These tests reproduce that post-reconcile state directly, by tracker rows
 * rather than through `Migrations.ts`, so they keep asserting the property the
 * migrations themselves own — every migration at or after this id survives
 * being applied a second time — independently of how reconciliation decides to
 * classify any particular lineage.
