// FILE: betaUsageSnapshot.ts
// Purpose: Computes the anonymous last-24h usage snapshot for Synara Beta.
// Layer: Server maintenance task — runs only on beta-flavor desktop builds.
//
// The desktop main process cannot reach the projection database, so the server
// writes counts to <betaHome>/diagnostics/usage-snapshot.json and the main
// process relays them as one `usage.daily` diagnostics event per UTC day.
// Only counts and provider names are written — never thread titles, paths,
// prompts, or provider payloads.
