/**
 * The pixel↔notch boundary for anything whose wheel speaks whole notches.

 * because one scroll must mean one thing on every desktop.

/**
 * Pixels per wheel notch.
 *
 * The pixels are *content* pixels: what a page actually moves when a physical
 * wheel clicks once. That is a toolkit decision, not a protocol one. Measured
 * in Firefox, which moves 85.5 px per notch (GDK's 1.5 units × three lines
 * of 19 px); Chromium's Wayland path works out to about 80 (1.5 × its 53 px
 * wheel delta); Qt and terminals do three lines, nearer 60. This is a nominal
 * figure close to the browsers, which is where the agent scrolls most, and the
 * tool surface promises "roughly" this much. It is also about what a browser
 * reports as `deltaY` for one notch, so a human notch on the computer pane
 * arrives on the desktop as about one notch.
 *
 * It is deliberately not libinput's 15 wire units per notch. Those are what a
 * compositor hands a client in `wl_pointer.axis` — degrees of wheel rotation,
 * which toolkits then scale up by a factor of three to seven — so treating
 * them as pixels made every scroll several times longer than it was asked to
 * be, and a 900 px request threw a page all the way to its bottom. The native
 * injectors convert pixels to notches with this constant and emit the
 * continuous axis value as notches × 15 on their own.
 *

 * `remainder`, so repeated small deltas add up to a notch across calls and
 * nothing is invented; carry it per axis.
