/**
 * The one place that decides "this is the OS withholding a grant", and which
 * grants those are.
 *
 * The same fact reaches the tool surface three different ways, and before this
 * module only the first of them raised the chat's setup card:
 *
 *   1. A **thrown** `ComputerBackendError` marked `setupRequired` — the helper
 *      refused an action with its permission-denied code.
 *   2. A **successful** result whose availability is `permission-required` — a
 *      perception read that completed and reported the desktop cannot be driven.
 *      This is the shape the user hit: the agent received a well-formed answer
 *      saying "Synara needs Accessibility", no card appeared, and the model was
 *      left to explain TCC in prose.
 *   3. A grant the backend knows is missing while nothing has failed yet —
 *      Screen Recording, which leaves the desktop driveable but unseeable, so
 *      the availability stays `available` and no call has to fail for the user
 *      to be owed the card.
 *
 * Classifying in one place is what keeps those three answering identically, and
 * what keeps an ordinary action failure — a window that moved, an undelivered
 * keystroke, arguments the desktop refused — from raising a card the user cannot
 * act on.
