/**
 * The coordinate frame a model points in: the screenshot it is looking at.
 *
 * A model does not see the desktop; it sees pictures of it, each one a
 * possibly downscaled crop at some offset. The earlier tool surface handed the
 * model the crop's `region` and `scale` and asked it to convert every pixel it
 * wanted to click into a desktop coordinate itself — across a workspace
 * overview squeezed to a third of its size and window captures offset by
 * thousands of pixels — and that arithmetic is where clicks went astray. The
 * official computer-use harnesses (OpenAI's `@oai/sky` client behind the Codex
 * app, Anthropic's computer tool) never ask for it: the model gives pixel
 * coordinates in the screenshot it was shown and the harness does the
 * geometry. This module is that geometry.
 *
 * Every screenshot delivered to a thread is remembered here as a frame with an
 * id; a target's x/y are pixels in the thread's most recent frame unless it
 * names an earlier one. Frames are per thread, because two agents looking at
 * different windows must not read each other's pictures, and bounded, because
 * a model only ever refers back a few screenshots.
