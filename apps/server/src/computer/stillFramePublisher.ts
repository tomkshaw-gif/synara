/**
 * The still-frame stream every Tier-1 desktop backend publishes.
 *
 * A Tier-1 backend has no video encoder: it pulls one still on a timer and
 * pushes it at whoever is watching the pane. The still is always scoped to the
 * thing the agent is using — one exact window, or one browser tab — and never
 * the whole desktop: a capture with no such target returns `undefined` and
 * nothing is published. The loop around that is identical on every display
 * server — one interval, one capture in flight at a time, a byte-identity
 * dedupe (`StillFrameDedupe`), and the `force` bookkeeping that guarantees a
 * receiver with nothing to draw gets a picture even when the target has not
 * changed.
 *
 * The part worth stating is the failure bound. An earlier version re-armed the
 * deferred force whenever a forced capture threw, and the `finally` block then
 * immediately republished because a force was pending — so a target whose
 * captures kept failing (a revoked Screen Recording grant, a window that moved
 * off the current Space) spun in a tight recursive retry loop for as long as
 * anyone watched the pane, with no delay between attempts. Here a failed force
 * buys exactly one immediate retry; after that the request is dropped and the
 * ordinary timer cadence takes over, so a persistent failure costs two captures
 * per interval instead of an unbounded recursion.
 *
