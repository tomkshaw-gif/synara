// FILE: groupWorkspaceScaffold.ts
// Purpose: Owns the managed Group workspace layout — mkdir of the group folder and the
//          agent-facing instruction files (AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md). Instructions are only
//          written when missing so user edits are never clobbered. Also owns the
//          delete-time cleanup: a group folder is removed only when everything left
//          inside is something Synara generated.
// Layer: Server workspace helper
// Exports: slugifyGroupTitle, ensureGroupWorkspaceInstructionsFiles, prepareGroupWorkspaceRoot,
//          cleanupGroupWorkspaceRoot

 *
 * Safety: only folders that are a direct child of `groupsWorkspaceRoot` are
 * ever removed (managed per-group folders — never a linked repository, a
 * custom Library folder, or the shared Groups root itself). Symlinks are
 * never followed: a symlinked root or any symlink entry keeps the folder.
