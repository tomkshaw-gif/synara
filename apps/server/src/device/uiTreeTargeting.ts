/**
 * Resolving an accessibility node to the point that actually taps it.
 *
 * Agents are bad at coordinate arithmetic and worse at knowing which
 * coordinate of a node is the live one, so this module is the single place
 * that answers "where do I tap to hit the thing called X". Both the MCP
 * `device_tap` tool and any future caller go through it rather than each
 * re-deriving a centre point from a frame.
 *
 * Two rules carry most of the value:
 *
 * - The tap point is the node's `activationPoint` when it has one. UIKit
 *   merges a settings row and the control inside it into one element whose
 *   frame spans the row, so the frame centre of a switch row is dead space.
 * - A match that is scrolled out of view is refused rather than tapped. Its
 *   frame is still in the tree with off-screen coordinates, and tapping it
 *   would hit whatever happens to be at that position instead.
 *
 * The matching itself — exact label before substring, ambiguity refused rather
 * than guessed — is `@synara/shared/uiTreeTargeting`, shared with the desktop
 * family. What stays here is what UIKit specifically needs: labels compared
 * with case and surrounding space ignored, a subrole that counts as a role, and
 * "on screen" meaning the tap point falls inside the display's own frame.
 *
 * @module device/uiTreeTargeting
