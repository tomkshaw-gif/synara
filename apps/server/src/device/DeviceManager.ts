/**
 * DeviceManager - thread-scoped device attachment and boot ownership.
 *
 * State the manager owns, and why it owns it rather than the backend:
 *
 * - Attachment is per thread (one device per thread, mirroring
 *   `ThreadBrowserState`). A thread's `ThreadDeviceState` is versioned and
 *   pushed on `device.event` so panes can drop stale snapshots.
 * - Boot source. The backend cannot tell who booted a device, so the manager
 *   records the devices it booted itself. Only those are ever auto-shut-down;
 *   anything the user started (pane picker, Simulator.app) outlives us.
 * - The Synara boot cap (`DEVICE_SYNARA_BOOT_LIMIT`). Boot past the cap is
 *   refusable rather than fatal: the caller is handed the shutdown candidates
 *   so the pane can prompt.
 * - Shutdown triggers: app quit (`dispose`), thread removal
 *   (`handleThreadRemoved`), and an idle timeout after the last detach.
 *
 * Everything the manager does to the device itself goes through DeviceBackend,
 * so the whole state machine is testable against `FakeDeviceBackend`.
 *
