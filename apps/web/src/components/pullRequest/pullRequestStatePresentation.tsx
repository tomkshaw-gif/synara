// FILE: pullRequestStatePresentation.tsx
// Purpose: Single source of truth for how a pull request's (and an issue's) state renders —
//          the sidebar thread badge, kanban card chip, list rows, detail panel, and dock tab
//          all resolve label, color, and glyph from here so no surface can drift. Icons come
//          from the three-node Central "reversed" family (pull-request / draft /
//          request-closed / merge-conflict); merged uses the Hugeicons workflow-circle-06.
// Layer: Pull request presentation
// Exports: PrStatePresentation, resolvePrStatePresentation, PR_STATE_PRESENTATION_ICONS,
//          IssueStatePresentation, resolveIssueStatePresentation, ISSUE_STATE_PRESENTATION_ICONS,
//          PullRequestConflictIcon
