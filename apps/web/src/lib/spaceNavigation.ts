// FILE: spaceNavigation.ts
// Purpose: Where selecting a Space lands, and which threads a Space is allowed to land on.
// Layer: Spaces domain helper
// Why: `isOrdinarySpaceProject` states which *projects* Spaces organize; every Space-scoped
//      navigation needs the thread-level consequence of that rule. The Space switcher and the
//      "/" restore landing both make that judgement, and spelling it out separately is exactly
//      how selecting an empty Space ended up restoring another Space's thread.
