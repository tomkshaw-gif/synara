// FILE: threadTurnInterrupt.ts
// Purpose: The one way a surface asks the server to stop a thread's current turn.
// Layer: Web command helper
// Exports: interruptThreadTurn
//
// Stopping a turn is also how the desktop is handed back: `ComputerManager`
// releases the exclusive lease the moment the owning thread stops being able to
// drive, which is turn end. So the chat's "Stop the agent" action is this and
// not a computer-specific kill path — a second mechanism could stop the desktop
// while the turn kept running, or the reverse, and the user would have no way to
// tell which one they had pressed.
