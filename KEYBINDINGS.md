# Keybindings

Synara reads keybindings from:

- `~/.synara/userdata/keybindings.json`

The file must be a JSON array of rules:

```json
[
  { "key": "mod+g", "command": "terminal.toggle" },
  { "key": "mod+shift+g", "command": "terminal.new", "when": "terminalFocus" }
]
```

See the full schema for more details: [`packages/contracts/src/keybindings.ts`](packages/contracts/src/keybindings.ts)

## Editing in Settings

Settings → Keybindings lists every built-in command with its shortcuts and writes the same file:

- The pencil opens the recorder: press the new keys, then Save (or Enter). Escape cancels. A shortcut needs ⌘, ⌥ or ⌃ (Ctrl or Alt elsewhere) unless it is an F-key.
- Some chords cannot be taken, because something else gets the key first. The list lives in [`apps/web/src/fixedShortcuts.ts`](apps/web/src/fixedShortcuts.ts):
  - text editing: Copy, Paste, Cut, Select All, Undo, Redo, plus line and word movement and deletion;
  - the system: Quit, Hide, and Minimize on macOS;
  - Synara's own chords:
    - Settings and the keybindings sheet;
    - back and forward in the desktop app (⌘[ / ⌘] on macOS, Alt+← / Alt+→ elsewhere);
    - file search (Mod+P) and search in files (Mod+Shift+F);
    - terminal search (Mod+F, only while the terminal has focus).
- If the chord types a character on your keyboard layout (for example ⌥L types "@" on a German Mac), the recorder warns that saving stops those keys from typing it.
- When the keys already run another command in a context that can overlap, the recorder names it and saving moves the shortcut over. If it has no other shortcuts, the other command is left unassigned. Commands for two different focused surfaces, such as `composerFocus` and `terminalFocus`, never overlap, because only one surface has focus at a time.
- The plus adds another shortcut to a command, and the trash removes one. A command with none left shows as Unassigned.
- "Jump to visible thread 1–9" and "Jump to space 1–9" are each rebound as one modifier combination across the number keys. Rebind a single number in the file and the list shows the nine commands separately.
- "Reset to default" in the recorder restores one command. If another command has since taken one of its shipped keys, the recorder names it first, and resetting takes the key back. "Reset all to defaults" restores every built-in command. Project script shortcuts are kept.
- If the bindings change while the recorder is open (another window, or `keybindings.json` edited by hand), it says so and won't save. The server also rejects any edit made against bindings that are no longer there.

A new shortcut takes the `when` condition its command ships with. Edit the file to change a condition.

In the desktop app, the View menu's New Terminal Tab, Toggle Sidebar, and Toggle Browser items follow unconditional shortcuts that do not share their keys with a conditional command. Conditional shortcuts stay in the app's keyboard dispatcher so their `when` conditions are respected; those menu items have no native accelerator. Unassigned commands also have no native accelerator. Menu clicks remain available.

Shortcuts follow the character your layout types: on AZERTY, the key labelled A fires a binding on `a`. A key that types something other than a letter or digit, such as Option+S typing "ß" on macOS or Shift+1 typing "!", matches by its physical key.

## Defaults

```json
[
  { "key": "mod+j", "command": "terminal.toggle" },
  { "key": "mod+d", "command": "terminal.split", "when": "terminalFocus" },
  { "key": "mod+n", "command": "terminal.new", "when": "terminalFocus" },
  { "key": "mod+w", "command": "terminal.close", "when": "terminalFocus" },
  { "key": "mod+n", "command": "chat.new", "when": "!terminalFocus" },
  { "key": "mod+shift+o", "command": "chat.new", "when": "!terminalFocus" },
  { "key": "mod+shift+n", "command": "chat.newLocal", "when": "!terminalFocus" },
  { "key": "mod+shift+t", "command": "chat.newTerminal", "when": "!terminalFocus" },
  { "key": "mod+alt+s", "command": "sidechat.toggle", "when": "!terminalFocus || isMac" },
  { "key": "cmd+l", "command": "composer.focus.toggle", "when": "!terminalFocus" },
  { "key": "alt+arrowdown", "command": "diff.change.next", "when": "!terminalFocus" },
  { "key": "alt+arrowup", "command": "diff.change.previous", "when": "!terminalFocus" },
  { "key": "mod+o", "command": "editor.openFavorite" },
  { "key": "mod+s", "command": "editor.file.save", "when": "!terminalFocus" }
]
```

## Configuration

### Rule Shape

Each entry supports:

- `key` (required): shortcut string, like `mod+j`, `ctrl+k`, `cmd+shift+d`
- `command` (required): action ID
- `when` (optional): boolean expression controlling when the shortcut is active

Invalid rules are ignored and reported as issues, and saving from Settings keeps them in the file as written. Invalid config files are ignored. Warnings are logged by the server. The file holds at most 256 rules: past that, saving from Settings is refused and nothing is dropped. Runtime snapshots reserve additional room for missing built-in defaults, so a full user file keeps every configured rule and the remaining default commands. Legacy files above 256 remain intact on disk; their newest 256 user rules are active, and edits that shrink them remain allowed.

### Unassigned Commands

A command with a default shortcut gets it back whenever the file has no rule for it. To leave such a command without a shortcut, give it the key `unassigned`:

```json
[{ "key": "unassigned", "command": "terminal.toggle" }]
```

Removing a command's last shortcut in Settings writes this rule. It never matches a key press, and adding a shortcut to the command in Settings replaces it.

### Available Commands

- `terminal.toggle`: open/close terminal drawer
- `terminal.split`: split terminal (in focused terminal context by default)
- `terminal.new`: create new terminal (in focused terminal context by default)
- `terminal.close`: close/kill the focused terminal (in focused terminal context by default)
- `chat.new`: create a new chat thread preserving the active thread's branch/worktree state
- `chat.newLocal`: create a new chat thread for the active project in a new environment (local/worktree determined by app settings (default `local`))
- `chat.newTerminal`: create a new terminal-first thread preserving the active thread's branch/worktree state
- `diff.change.next`: scroll the diff panel to the next changed file (only while the diff panel is open)
- `diff.change.previous`: scroll the diff panel to the previous changed file (only while the diff panel is open)
- `sidechat.toggle`: open or hide the active main thread's side chat panel
- `composer.focus.toggle`: focus or blur the chat prompt composer
- `thread.copyId`: copy the active thread's ID to the clipboard
- `editor.openFavorite`: open current project/worktree in the last-used editor
- `editor.file.save`: write the focused file editor's unsaved changes back to disk (editor view file and diff editors)
- `script.{id}.run`: run a project script by id (for example `script.test.run`)

`sidechat.toggle` defaults to ⌘⌥S on macOS and Ctrl+Alt+S elsewhere. In the single-chat view, it reopens an existing side chat (or creates one using `/side`) and focuses its composer. Pressing it again hides the panel and focuses the main composer without interrupting either chat. Escape also hides a visible side chat when no menu or dialog needs dismissal; terminal input keeps Escape. The shortcut can be changed in Settings → Keyboard shortcuts.

Enter while a composer voice note is recording is not a configurable command: a plain Enter (no modifiers) finishes the recording instead of sending the typed draft. Settings → Behavior → Enter while dictating decides whether it only transcribes into the composer (the default) or also sends the message once the transcript is in.

### Key Syntax

Supported modifiers:

- `mod` (`cmd` on macOS, `ctrl` on non-macOS)
- `cmd` / `meta`
- `ctrl` / `control`
- `shift`
- `alt` / `option`

Examples:

- `mod+j`
- `mod+shift+d`
- `ctrl+l`
- `cmd+k`

### `when` Conditions

Currently available context keys:

- `terminalFocus`
- `terminalOpen`

Supported operators:

- `!` (not)
- `&&` (and)
- `||` (or)
- parentheses: `(` `)`

Examples:

- `"when": "terminalFocus"`
- `"when": "terminalOpen && !terminalFocus"`
- `"when": "terminalFocus || terminalOpen"`

Unknown condition keys evaluate to `false`.

### Precedence

- Rules are evaluated in array order.
- For a key event, the last rule where both `key` matches and `when` evaluates to `true` wins.
- That means precedence is across commands, not only within the same command.
