// FILE: desktopChrome.ts
// Purpose: Single source of truth for the macOS desktop top-bar chrome geometry that
//          BOTH the Electron main process and the web renderer must agree on.
// Layer: Shared runtime utilities (no deps; safe to import from main + renderer)
//
// Why this exists:
//   The native macOS traffic lights are placed by the Electron main process
//   (apps/desktop), while the chrome bar they must visually sit inside is rendered by
//   the web app (apps/web). Their vertical centers only line up if the two packages
//   agree on the header height and the dot size. These used to be two hand-synced
//   magic numbers in different packages and silently drifted (a 12px-dot assumption
//   left the lights 1px below the controls). Deriving everything from the constants
//   here keeps them locked together: change the height/radius once, in this file.

/**
 * Height (px) of the chat-surface top chrome bar — the row shared by the chat,
 * settings, workspace, and (open) sidebar headers. The web side renders this as the
 * Tailwind class `h-[44px]` (kept literal so Tailwind can scan it; guarded against
 * drift from this number in apps/web/.../chatHeaderControls.tsx). Keep it even: the
 * native traffic lights take whole points, so an odd height cannot center them.
