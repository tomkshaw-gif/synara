 * What to tell a user whose System Settings already shows Synara switched on

 * what happened.
 *
 * macOS pins an ad-hoc signature's grant to the binary's cdhash, so a local
 * rebuild invalidates it without changing anything the user can see. A
 * Developer ID signature keys on identifier plus team and survives rebuilds, so
 * this advice would be a red herring on a release build and is withheld there.
 * The grant is filed against the app, not the helper bundle it spawns, which is
 * why the reset names the app's identifier.
 *
 * The application does not reset grants automatically. The user can remove
 * and re-add this specific build in System Settings, or reset its own bundle
 * explicitly when the responsible identity is known.
 *
 * `bundleId` is the *responsible* app's identifier — the Synara the grant is
 * actually filed against, which `.dev` and `.canary` builds do not share with a
 * released one. It is optional because nothing can derive it: a server started
 * outside the desktop shell has no app behind it, and the desktop tells the
 * backend which flavor it is through
 * `SYNARA_DESKTOP_BUNDLE_ID_ENV`. When it is unknown the whole `tccutil`
 * sentence is withheld rather than printed with a guess, because the guess a
 * user would paste into Terminal resets a *different* Synara's grants — the one
 * they have installed — and leaves this one exactly as broken as before.
